### How the site functions
* There is a theme of preset array of strings
* Using the array the buttons are created dynamically on the page. 
* When the user clicks on a button, the page should gets 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. The user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
* Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).
* There is a form that takes the value from a user in the input box and adds it into the preset array. Then makes a function call that takes each topic in the array remakes the buttons on the page.
